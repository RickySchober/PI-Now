Pi NOW is a chrome browser extension 
THAT enables more people to buy the hardware they need by alerting them as soon as it comes in stock online

The front end of this project uses Chrome Extension which calls a python script on the backend using a flask API. 
The background script is a web scraper which fetches sale data on Rasberry PIs from most prominent websites
