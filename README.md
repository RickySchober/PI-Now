Pi NOW is a chrome browser extension that enables more people to buy the hardware they need by alerting them as soon as it comes in stock online.
This was a small project I worked on with a team.

The front end of this project uses Chrome Extension which calls a python script on the backend using a flask API. 
The background script is a web scraper which fetches sale data on Rasberry PIs from most prominent websites
